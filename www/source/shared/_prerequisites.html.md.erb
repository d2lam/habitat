## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have completed the [Download and Install]() steps on your workstation.

Also, if you chose _containers_ as your runtime environment, we will be using Docker Compose in that version of the tutorial. If you already have
Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows installed and running, then you are setup to use Docker Compose. For Linux users, please follow the
[installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for Docker Compose.

> Note: The minimum Docker version required for Habitat is greater than or equal to the version specified in the `core/docker` plan, which currently is 1.11.2.

If you chose _VMs_, then install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your workstation platform. We will reference a Vagrantfile later in the tutorial.

Also, if you are running an older Windows 10 version such as 1511, ANSI escape sequences are not supported. This means the color output and other formatting used
by the `hab` CLI will not render properly in your PowerShell window. You can use console emulators like [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) to run PowerShell with ANSI color support.
