Habitat provides basic health monitoring for your running service; however, if you want to 
perform custom smoke tests or other status checks, you can customize your plan to do that. This is 
done by using a `health_check` hook, which is a script that responds to a specific event during the lifecycle 
of a running service.

There are multiple hooks that you can define in your plan. For example, the `init` and `run` hooks are responsible 
for defining behavior during initialization and when the child service/application starts up. The Ruby scaffolding 
creates these for you to handle connecting to a backend database. However, to create the `health_check`` hook, we have 
to perform the following operations:

1. Change directory to `hooks`.

       $ cd hooks

2. Create a new file named `health_check`.

       $ touch health_check

3. Open `health_check` in your text editor.
4. Hooks use [shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) to decide which interpreter to use when running their scripts. 
In the case of the hook in our plan, we will use the system shell, so add the following to the `health_check` hook file:

       #!/bin/sh
       #

       # default return code is 0
       rc=0

       # This request will test whether our index page can be retrieved. 
       hab pkg exec core/curl curl -sS --head --fail --max-time 1 http://localhost:{{cfg.app.port}}/

       case $? in
         # Zero exit status means curl got back a 200 end everything is ok.
         0)
           rc=0 ;;
         # Anything else is critical.
         *)
           rc=2 ;;
       esac

       exit $rc
       
    This hook performs a basic smoke test to check whether our index page is available for requests. If the curl command doesn't succeed, then 

5. Save the `health_check` hook file.
