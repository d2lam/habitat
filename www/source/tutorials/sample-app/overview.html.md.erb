# Building a Sample App 

One of the key tenets in Habitat is that every Habitat package is immutable. Habitat accomplishes this by bundling your application and configuration behavior with only the dependencies your app requires. Building packages in Habitat requires two things: the application you want to package, and the plan for how that application should be built and configured. And to streamline the process of creating a plan for your application, Habitat includes default implementations of how to build and configure specific app types such as Node.js and Ruby-on-Rails web applications. These default implementations are called [scaffolding](/docs/concepts-scaffolding) and will be what we use in this tutorial.

The sample application we are packaging is a basic Ruby-on-Rails web application that connects to a PostgreSQL database to form a simple two-tier solution. The index page randomly selects a phrase to show when the page is refreshed.

If you went through the [interactive CLI demo](), this tutorial will show you how to build the application that we used in that demo.
